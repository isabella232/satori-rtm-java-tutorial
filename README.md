# Java SDK Tutorial

Satori is a cloud-based, live data ecosystem for filtering, and building apps on top of any schema-less real-time live data.

This tutorial uses Satori RTM Java SDK to create a simple command-line publish-subscribe app.

Use the following Apache Maven command to run an app:

```
mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.mycompany.App"
```
